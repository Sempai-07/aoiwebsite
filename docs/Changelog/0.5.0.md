# AoiTelegram@0.5.0

## Parser Changes
* Implemented functions without parameters together, such as `$pingms`.
* Allowed any case for functions, e.g., `$piNg`.
* Use `[]` to represent an array (or use brackets inside a function).
* Introduced `$if/$endif/$elseIf/$endelseif`.
* Enhanced error logging to the console for clearer messages.
* Improved or fixed various methods.
* Removed type parsing; now only strings are parsed.
* Code now read from bottom to top starting from version 0.5.0 and above.
* Removed `varReplaceOption` option.
