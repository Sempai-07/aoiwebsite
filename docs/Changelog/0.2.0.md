# AoiTelegram@0.2.0

## Added

* Added parsing of the `object`, `undefined`, `null`, `float`, `integer`, `boolean`, and `NaN` types (to help with parsing custom functions)
* Added the `<Context>.getEvaluateArgs` method, which combines the `<Context>.getArgs` and `<Context>.evaluateArgs` methods into a single method for easier use in custom functions
* Added the `<Context>.checkArgumentTypes` method for checking the types of arguments passed to custom functions
* Added the `<AoiClient>.removeFunction` method for removing a function from the list of custom functions
* Added the `autoUpdate` option to the constructor of the `AoiClient` class to automatically update the library to the latest version (defaults to `false`)
* Added the ability to return only a string in `<AoiClient>.addFunction`, instead of a function
* Added the `default` import of classes and constants from the library
* Added import of the `DataFunction` type has been added so that you can use it in the custom function loader for `typescript`.
* This update added methods and functions related to intervals and timeouts. Intervals execute code infinitely at regular intervals (they are restarted when the bot is restarted, not continued). Timeouts execute code after a specified time and only once (when the bot is restarted, they do not stop but continue to work until the time runs out and the command is executed)
  * Added the `<AoiClient>.loopCommand` method to start a loop that will execute code at a specified interval (can be stopped using `$break`)
  * Added the `<AoiClient>.timeoutCommand` method to register a timeout command that will be called by `$setTimeout`
  * Added the `<AoiClient>.awaitedCommand` method to start a loop that will execute code at a specified interval using the `$loop` method
  * This is also supported by the loader [documentation](https://aoitelegram-dev.surge.sh/).

## Fixed

* The `<AoiClient>.command`, `<AoiClient>.action`, and the loader created multiple event handlers, which could lead to inefficient use of resources and code complexity
* Fixed an error where a function was used where there were no available methods to run it, and instead of an error in the chat, we received an error that there was no `this.telegram.send` method, now a normal error will be displayed in the console about this (this happened when we checked the function parameters)
* In the loader for `action`, the expected parameters expected `options.action` instead of `options.data`

## Changed

* The text of errors has been changed, both text and console errors
* The `default` import of commands and functions has been changed, now instead of `export const data = {}` you will have to use `export default {}`. Improved for TypeScript users
* The package now fully uses `node-fetch` instead of `axios`
* All methods for events `<AoiClient>.<nameEvent>Command`, `<AoiClient>.command`, `<AoiClient>.action`, `<AoiClient>.timeoutCommand`, `<AoiClient>.awaitedCommand` return the same `AoiClient` class for convenient use
* In the `<Context>.argsCheck` method, you no longer need to specify the variable name

## Other

* The function register no longer affects the call
* Dependencies have been updated to more reliable ones
* Now supports `nodejs@v14`, not as previously `nodejs@v16` and higher
* Improved parsing of `object/json` types
* Improved source code, i.e. comments, code optimization
