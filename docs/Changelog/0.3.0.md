# AoiTelegram@0.3.0

## Added

* Added a text error when using internal library functions (only when an error occurs)
* Added parsing of the `\n` symbol
* Added the `disableFunctions` parameter to the `AoiClient` class constructor, which disables the loading of the specified functions from the library
* Added the `functionError` parameter to the `AoiClient` class constructor the error handler is enabled when an error occurs in the library functions
* Added the `functionErrorCommand` method to the `<AoiClient>` class for tracking
* Added the `varReplaceOption` parameter to the `AoiClient` class constructor, which adds parsing of local variables in the following syntax: `&localVar&`
* Added the `sendMessageError` parameter to the `AoiClient` class constructor, which disables text errors
* Added methods for database events `<AoiClient>.variableDeleteCommand`, `<AoiClient>.variableUpdateCommand`, `<AoiClient>.variableCreateCommand` (for the event loaders `variableCreate`, `variableUpdate`, `variableDelete`)
* Added the ability to specify types through `...type` in the `<Context>.checkArgumentTypes` method. The subsequent types of arguments must match the specified type `...number` (it is not possible to specify `["...string", "number"]`!)
* Added the `<Context>.getAoiArgs` method, which returns parameters in custom functions as in `aoi.js`
* Added the `<Context>.setStopping` method to stop the execution of further code

## Updated

* The parameter in the `AoiClient` constructor has been renamed from `aoiwarning` to `aoiWarning`
* `database-sempai` has been replaced with `@aoitelegram/database`
* Empty values are now treated as `undefined`
* Error names have been changed for more accurate identification
* The parsing for `condition` parameters has been changed (you can now use `&&` and `||`)
* Parameters where milliseconds had to be specified have been changed. Now you can only specify the time in the form of a string: `1h`, `1m`, etc.
* The loading of library functions and the execution of `command`, `action`, `timeout` have been slightly accelerated
* For each function in the library, it is now indicated exactly what error occurred. In 0.2.1, this was automatically indicated, but when using multiple functions, the error was displayed for the wrong function.
* Event typing has been improved

## Fixes

* The parsing of the `object` type in the `<Context>.checkArgumentTypes` method has been fixed

## Deleted

* The parsing of the operators `==`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, `!=` has been removed

## AoiTelegram Function

* Added/changed/renamed many functions
